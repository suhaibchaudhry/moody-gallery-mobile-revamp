Cute Facets creates blocks with good looking conditional facets from taxonomy views filters. Any exposed vocabulary filters on the page same as the block will be converted to facets. Primary taxonomy vocabularies are exposed right away, while non primary can be set as children of terms from the primary vocabularies, they appear on the fly when the appopriate term is selected. A JQuery UI Slider or plain lists can be used to display a particular vocabulary, do keep in mind that JQuery UI slider vocabularies do not support child facets.

Note: Enable DA JS Updater for touch compatibility and robustness.
